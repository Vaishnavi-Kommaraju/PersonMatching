# PersonMatching
Person matching in photo collections. 

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to retrieve the photos that belong to a certain individual given a query image. <br>
* Person matching is a problem of matching feature descriptor that describes a person across images consisting of multiple objects(people). <br>
* This problem typically arises in face detection and matching computer vision tasks. Itâ€™s applications include security surveillance, Google Photos,  apps where they find similar faces etc.<br>
* We pose the problem of person matching as an image retrieval task with predefined probe and gallery set.<br>
